## RogueLike
- Unity project that our small group of friends decided to build
- By the title, it describes it as a Rogue Like, but it is also a platformer where your character has to fight its way through victory
- Multiple story levels with different types of obstacles
- Multiple enemies types and types of attacks and animations
- At the end of the game there is a 2 stage boss fight to complete the game.

- Project I am the most proud of as it already proves that the concept is viable
- Control someone elses game over Discord when they assign you the role
- Utilises low-level networking with sockets
