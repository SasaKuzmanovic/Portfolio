## Controller Sharing over Discord
- My Final Year Project that creates controller sharing between two computers using Discord
- Project I am the most proud of as it already proves that the concept is viable
- Control someone elses game over Discord when they assign you the role
- Utilises low-level networking with sockets

## Atomic Diner 
- Project I was working on as part of my Real World Modelling subject from the #TURNIP&DUCK Company
- Game for children based on the cartoon called # ATOM TOWN 
- Created a game where children can prepare food for each one of the elements.

## Rabbits Game 
- My first ever game created in assembly
- Project where we had to create a turn-text based game in assembly

## Texturing OpenGL
- As a part of my Computer Architecture project we were learning how to put textures and shaders on certain objects
- Texturing plains on the screen with a given texture

## RogueLike
- Unity project that our small group of friends decided to build
- By the title, it describes it as a Rogue Like, but it is also a platformer where your character has to fight its way through victory
- Multiple story levels with obstacles
- Multiple enemies and types of attack
- At the end of the game there is a 2 stage boss fight to complete the game.
